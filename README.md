# Coloretto

This is a Unity implementation of the famous Coloretto card game by Michael Schacht.
The game itself is not finished. After each round the game stops and there are no buttons to help you!
But the point of all of this was to test the AI. It is based on neural networks and it was trained with genetic algorithm by playing against itself countless times.
